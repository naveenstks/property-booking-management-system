# 🚀 Property Booking Management - Ready for Deployment!

## ✅ What's Been Fixed & Prepared

### 1. **Delete Function Issue - RESOLVED** ✅
- **Problem**: Delete function wasn't working due to separate in-memory arrays
- **Solution**: Created shared booking store (`src/lib/bookingStore.ts`)
- **Result**: All CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) now work perfectly

### 2. **Update Function - WORKING** ✅
- Booking selection populates form correctly
- Form switches to "Update Booking" mode
- Updates are saved and reflected immediately

### 3. **Production Build - OPTIMIZED** ✅
- Fixed Next.js async params warning
- Added ESLint configuration for cleaner builds
- Updated package.json for production deployment
